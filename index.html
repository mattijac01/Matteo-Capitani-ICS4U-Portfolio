        <h2 align="center">these are 10 modules that show what I've learnt</h2>
        <h3 class ="coursename">1 - Advanced JS: Natural Simulations</h3>

        <p class = "paragraph">I'm going to start by saying this module was by far my favourite. I learnt about object, randomness, movement based on forces and vectors, not only in a computer science mindset, but also real world applications of these ideas. The concepts I learned in this module will help me in my continued studies of computer science/programming but also in my physics and math courses I will take in the future. The module showed me a different way to look at physics and math. I believe that the object oriented mentality I developed in this module helped me to learn and complete assignments this semester, but also will help me in my future computer science and programming endeavors.</p>
        <h3 class ="coursename">2 - Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation</h3>
        <a href="https://imgur.com/xMsco7m"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xMsco7m.png" title="source: imgur.com"/></a>
        <p>This module mostly taught me the basics of Javascript and gave me a good base to build off during my learning throughout the rest of the semester. In this module I learnt the basic syntax of Javascript, the format that programmers use when writing in Javascript and got a small glimpse of object oriented programming. This module has and will help me throughout my learning because it built my base knowledge of the Javascript language and as long as im using javascript I will use what ive learnt in this module.</p>
